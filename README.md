# Memory Matching Game
This is the repository for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree's Mmeory Game Project part of the JavaScript section.

I'm required to make a responsive, interactive memory game using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6).

I'll also be using Bootstrap's grid system to help with responsiveness.

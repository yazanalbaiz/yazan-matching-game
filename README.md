# Memory Matching Game
This is the repository for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree's Mmeory Game Project part of the JavaScript section.

I'm required to make a responsive, interactive memory game using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6).

I'll also be using Bootstrap's grid system to help with responsiveness.

-----
## Usage
Download the repository and run `index.html`.

-----
## How to play :
- Load the page.
- Wait for the cards to hide.
- Click on a card to reveal.
- Click on another card to see if they match.

-----
## Dependancies
Just a browser :)

-----
## Attribution

- I have used [font awesome](fontawesome.com) Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) icons as the faces for the cards and I have modified their sizes.
